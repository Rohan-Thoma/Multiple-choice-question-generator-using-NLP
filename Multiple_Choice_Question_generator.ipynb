    "### Problem statement: <br>\n",
    "We are tasked with developing a solution that can automatically generate\n",
    "objective questions with multiple correct answers based on a given chapter from a subject.\n",
    "The generated questions should test the reader's understanding of the chapter and have\n",
    "more than one possible correct answer to increase the complexity and challenge of the\n",
    "questions.The generated questions should not only test the reader's comprehension of the\n",
    "chapter but also encourage them to think beyond the surface level and explore different\n",
    "perspectives and possibilities. Ultimately, the objective of this project is to develop a robust\n",
    "and accurate solution that can aid educators in creating engaging and challenging\n",
    "assessments for their students.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution methodology:\n",
    "Here the goal of the problem is a little complex, where developing a solution from scratch takes time and thorough training and fine tuning on certain domain specific data. Although there are many API's available like gpt-3 etc, as this problem is posed in the interest of production usage for any company, we cannot rely on external API's very much. But we have taken small pretrained models here and demonstrated the overall work flow of the project, how to develop the solution for this kind of a problem.\n",
    "In the interesr=t of time, here a model which generates multiple choice questions with a single answer is developed and further steps are given in the future scope of the problem, where more robust model for this particular task will be developed later.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Procedure outline:\n",
    "Very useful resource where the current solution is inspired from : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoCi_bJHyb8\n",
    "1. Given any article we will perform an Extractive summarization ( which means we pick out the important sentences as they are and form a summary ) or Abstractive summarization ( where we get the summary of the text with a slightly changed phrasing or rewriting of the sentences )\n",
    "2. If we perform Extractive summarization, we will perform paraphrasing of sentences using a language model.\n",
    "3. Then we will extract the keywords from the processed text using models like (YAKE, TopicRank, KeyBERT, Multi-partitite algorithm etc )\n",
    "4. Then we will generate the questions about the extracted keywords by giving the processed text along with the keyword to the fine-tuned model.\n",
    "5. Then we generate the distractors/wrong choices for the model using ( wordnet, sense2vec or word2vec etc). \n",
    "6. Now we got the question with the set of correct answer and also the wrong answers, so we will display the result."

    "text_1 = \"Automobili Lamborghini, the illustrious Italian manufacturer of luxury sports cars and SUVs, is headquartered in the picturesque Sant'Agata Bolognese. This renowned automotive institution boasts a storied legacy, and its contemporary success is firmly underpinned by a fascinating history that has seen it evolve through ownership changes, economic downturns, and groundbreaking innovations.\\\n",
    "Ferruccio Lamborghini, a prominent Italian industrialist with a passion for automobiles, laid the foundation for this iconic marque in 1963. His vision was audacious - to challenge the supremacy of Ferrari, the undisputed titan of Italian sports cars. Under Ferruccio's guidance, Automobili Ferruccio Lamborghini S.p.A. was established, and it immediately began making waves in the automotive world.\\\n",
    "One of the hallmarks of Lamborghini's early years was its distinctive rear mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout. This design philosophy became synonymous with Lamborghini's commitment to creating high-performance vehicles. The company's inaugural models, such as the 350 GT, arrived in the mid-1960s and showcased Lamborghini's dedication to precision engineering and uncompromising quality.\\\n",
    "Lamborghini's ascendancy was nothing short of meteoric during its formative decade. It consistently pushed the boundaries of automotive technology and design. However, the heady days of growth were met with a sudden downturn when the world faced the harsh realities of the 1973 global financial crisis and the subsequent oil embargo. Lamborghini, like many other automakers, grappled with plummeting sales and financial instability.\\\n",
    "Ownership of Lamborghini underwent multiple transitions in the wake of these challenges. The company faced bankruptcy in 1978, marking a turbulent chapter in its history. The ownership baton changed hands several times, with different entities attempting to steer the storied brand to calmer waters.\\\n",
    "In 1987, American automaker Chrysler Corporation took the helm at Lamborghini. The Chrysler era saw Lamborghini continue to produce remarkable vehicles like the Diablo while operating under the umbrella of a global conglomerate. However, it was not a permanent arrangement.\\\n",
    "In 1994, Malaysian investment group Mycom Setdco and Indonesian group V'Power Corporation acquired Lamborghini, signaling another phase of transformation for the company. These new custodians brought fresh perspectives and investment to the brand, fueling its resurgence.\\\n",
    "A significant turning point occurred in 1998 when Mycom Setdco and V'Power sold Lamborghini to the Volkswagen Group, which placed the Italian marque under the stewardship of its Audi division. This move brought newfound stability and resources, ensuring Lamborghini's enduring presence in the luxury sports car arena.\\\n",
    "Over the ensuing years, Lamborghini witnessed remarkable expansions in its product portfolio. The V10-powered Huracán captured the hearts of sports car enthusiasts with its exquisite design and formidable performance. Simultaneously, Lamborghini ventured into the SUV market with the Urus, a groundbreaking vehicle powered by a potent twin-turbo V8 engine. This diversification allowed Lamborghini to cater to a broader range of customers without compromising on its commitment to luxury and performance.\\\n",
    "While these successes were noteworthy, Lamborghini was not immune to the challenges posed by global economic fluctuations. In the late 2000s, during the worldwide financial crisis and the subsequent economic downturn, Lamborghini's sales experienced a significant decline, illustrating the brand's vulnerability to external economic factors.\\\n",
    "Despite these challenges, Lamborghini maintained its relentless pursuit of automotive excellence. The company's flagship model, the V12-powered Aventador, reached the pinnacle of automotive engineering and design before concluding its production run in 2022. However, the story does not end here. Lamborghini is set to introduce the Revuelto, a V12/electric hybrid model, in 2024, exemplifying its commitment to embracing cutting-edge technologies and pushing the boundaries of performance.\\\n",
    "In addition to its road car production, Lamborghini has made notable contributions to other industries. The company manufactures potent V12 engines for offshore powerboat racing, further underscoring its prowess in high-performance engineering.\\\n",
    "Interestingly, Lamborghini's legacy extends beyond the realm of automobiles. Ferruccio Lamborghini founded Lamborghini Trattori in 1948, a separate entity from the automobile manufacturer, which continues to produce tractors to this day.\\\n",
    "Lamborghini's rich history is also intertwined with the world of motorsport. In a stark contrast to his rival Enzo Ferrari, Ferruccio Lamborghini decided early on not to engage in factory-supported racing, considering it too expensive and resource-intensive. Nonetheless, Lamborghini's engineers, many of whom were passionate about racing, embarked on ambitious projects, including the development of the iconic Miura sports coupe, which possessed racing potential while being road-friendly. This project marked a pivotal moment in Lamborghini's history, showcasing its ability to create vehicles that could excel on both the track and the road.Despite Ferruccio's reluctance, Lamborghini did make some forays into motorsport. In the mid-1970s, while under the management of Georges-Henri Rossetti, Lamborghini collaborated with BMW to develop and manufacture 400 cars for BMW, a venture intended to meet Group 4 homologation requirements. However, due to financial instability and delays in development, BMW eventually took control of the project, finishing it without Lamborghini's involvement.\\\n",
    "Lamborghini also briefly supplied engines to Formula One teams from 1989 to 1993. Teams like Larrousse, Lotus, Ligier, Minardi, and Modena utilized Lamborghini power units during this period. Lamborghini's best result in Formula One was achieved when Aguri Suzuki finished third at the 1990 Japanese Grand Prix.\\\n",
    "In addition to Formula One, Lamborghini was involved in other racing series. Notably, racing versions of the Diablo were developed for the Diablo Supertrophy, a single-model racing series that ran from 1996 to 1999. The Murciélago R-GT, a production racing car, was created to compete in events like the FIA GT Championship and the American Le Mans Series in 2004, achieving notable results in its racing endeavors.\\\n",
    "Lamborghini's connection with motorsport reflects the brand's commitment to engineering excellence, even though it shied away from factory-backed racing for much of its history.\\\n",
    "Beyond the realms of automotive engineering, Lamborghini has carved a distinct niche in the world of branding. The company licenses its prestigious brand to manufacturers who produce a wide array of Lamborghini-branded consumer goods, including scale models, clothing, accessories, bags, electronics, and even laptop computers. This strategic approach has enabled Lamborghini to extend its brand reach beyond the confines of the automotive industry.\\\n",
    "One fascinating aspect of Lamborghini's identity is its deep connection with the world of bullfighting. In 1962, Ferruccio Lamborghini visited the ranch of Don Eduardo Miura, a renowned breeder of Spanish fighting bulls. Impressed by the majestic Miura animals, Ferruccio decided to adopt a raging bull as the emblem for his burgeoning automaker. This emblem, now iconic, symbolizes Lamborghini's passion for performance, power, and the thrill of the chase.\\\n",
    "Lamborghini's vehicle nomenclature also reflects this bullfighting heritage, with many models bearing the names of famous fighting bulls or bull-related themes. The Miura, named after the Miura bulls, set the precedent, and subsequent models like the Murciélago, Gallardo, and Aventador continued this tradition.\\\n",
    "Furthermore, Lamborghini has enthusiastically embraced emerging automotive technologies, responding to environmental concerns and changing consumer preferences. The Sian, introduced as the company's first hybrid model, showcases Lamborghini's commitment to sustainable performance. With its innovative hybrid powertrain, the Sian combines electric propulsion with a naturally aspirated V12 engine to deliver breathtaking performance while minimizing emissions.\\\n",
    "Looking ahead, Lamborghini has ambitious plans to produce an all-electric vehicle, aligning with the broader industry trend towards electrification. While traditionalists may lament the absence of roaring V12 engines, Lamborghini recognizes the importance of evolving with the times, ensuring that future generations of enthusiasts can experience the thrill of a Lamborghini while contributing to a more sustainable future.\\\n",
    "In summary, Automobili Lamborghini stands as a testament to the enduring allure of Italian craftsmanship and automotive excellence. From its audacious beginnings as a challenger to Ferrari, Lamborghini has weathered storms, embraced innovation, and left an indelible mark on the world of sports cars. Its legacy is one of design brilliance, relentless pursuit of power, and a commitment to pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the realm of high-performance automobiles. Whether through its iconic V12-powered supercars, groundbreaking hybrids, or electrifying visions of the future, Lamborghini continues to captivate the hearts of automotive enthusiasts worldwide, cementing its status as a legendary and iconic brand.\"\n",

    "text_2 = \"Elon Musk and Bitcoin: A Complex Relationship.The intersection of Elon Musk, the enigmatic billionaire entrepreneur, and Bitcoin, the groundbreaking cryptocurrency, has been the subject of much fascination, speculation, and scrutiny in recent years. Musk, known for his ventures like Tesla, SpaceX, Neuralink, and The Boring Company, has proven to be a polarizing figure in the world of finance and technology, with his tweets and actions having significant implications for the price and perception of Bitcoin. This narrative explores the multifaceted relationship between Elon Musk and Bitcoin, delving into key events, controversies, and the broader implications for the cryptocurrency landscape.Elon Musk: A Brief Overview.Before delving into Musk's connection with Bitcoin, it's essential to understand who Elon Musk is and his role in the tech and automotive industries. Born in South Africa in 1971, Musk displayed a prodigious talent for technology from a young age. He moved to the United States to attend the University of Pennsylvania, where he earned dual bachelor's degrees in physics and economics.Musk's entrepreneurial journey began with the creation of Zip2, a software company he co-founded in 1995, which provided business directories and maps for newspapers. In 1999, Compaq acquired Zip2 for nearly $300 million, providing Musk with his first significant windfall.With his newfound wealth, Musk co-founded X.com, an online payment company, in 1999. X.com later evolved into PayPal and was sold to eBay in 2002 for $1.5 billion. Musk, however, did not rest on his laurels. Instead, he turned his attention to two ambitious and groundbreaking industries: electric vehicles and space exploration.Tesla, SpaceX, and Beyond.In 2004, Musk founded Tesla Motors (now Tesla, Inc.), with the goal of accelerating the world's transition to sustainable energy. Tesla's electric vehicles, beginning with the Roadster and followed by models like the Model S, Model 3, Model X, and Model Y, have transformed the automotive industry. Tesla's innovations in battery technology and electric drivetrains have played a crucial role in popularizing electric cars.Musk's SpaceX, founded in 2002, has achieved remarkable milestones in the field of space exploration. SpaceX developed the Falcon 1, the first privately developed liquid-fueled rocket to reach orbit, and later the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy, which have significantly reduced the cost of launching payloads into space. SpaceX also aims to establish a human presence on Mars through its Starship spacecraft.Beyond Tesla and SpaceX, Musk has pursued other ventures. Neuralink focuses on developing brain-computer interface technology, while The Boring Company is dedicated to creating underground transportation tunnels to alleviate urban congestion.Musk's achievements and ambitions have made him one of the most influential and scrutinized figures in the tech and business worlds. His social media presence, especially on Twitter, where he often shares updates on his companies and personal thoughts, has further amplified his reach and impact.Bitcoin: A Digital Revolution.Bitcoin, conceived in a 2008 whitepaper by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, is a decentralized digital currency that operates on a peer-to-peer network. It represents a fundamental departure from traditional financial systems, as it doesn't rely on centralized authorities like banks or governments to validate and record transactions. Instead, Bitcoin transactions are confirmed by a network of computers, secured by cryptography, and recorded on a public ledger called the blockchain.Bitcoin's value proposition includes security, transparency, and the potential to serve as a store of value, similar to gold. It has gained traction as a means of transferring funds across borders, as a hedge against inflation, and as a speculative investment.As Bitcoin's popularity grew, it attracted attention from a diverse range of individuals and institutions, including tech entrepreneurs like Elon Musk.Elon Musk's Early Interest in Bitcoin.Musk's interest in Bitcoin became apparent through his tweets and comments on various occasions. While he didn't dive headfirst into the cryptocurrency, he showed a fascination with its technology and potential.In 2019, during a podcast interview with Ark Invest's Cathie Wood, Musk stated that Bitcoin is \\\"a far better way to transfer value than pieces of paper.\\\" He acknowledged its utility as a means of circumventing traditional financial intermediaries, highlighting its appeal to those who want greater control over their funds.Musk's acknowledgment of Bitcoin as a valuable innovation added to its credibility and mainstream acceptance. However, it was in the subsequent years that Musk's relationship with Bitcoin would become more complex, leading to significant fluctuations in the cryptocurrency's price and public perception.Tesla's Bitcoin Investment: A Game-Changer.The most pivotal moment in Elon Musk's involvement with Bitcoin came in early 2021 when Tesla, Inc. announced a groundbreaking move. In a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Tesla revealed that it had purchased $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin and intended to accept Bitcoin as a form of payment for its electric vehicles.This announcement sent shockwaves through the financial world, as it marked one of the most substantial endorsements of Bitcoin by a major corporation to date. Tesla's decision to allocate a portion of its corporate treasury to Bitcoin was seen as a bold move, signaling confidence in the cryptocurrency's long-term value.The rationale behind Tesla's Bitcoin investment, as outlined in its SEC filing, revolved around diversifying and maximizing returns on its cash reserves. Traditional avenues for cash management, like holding government bonds or placing funds in interest-bearing accounts, were yielding minimal returns. By allocating some of its capital to Bitcoin, Tesla sought to benefit from the cryptocurrency's potential for appreciation.This move had immediate repercussions on the price of Bitcoin, which surged to new all-time highs, surpassing $60,000 per BTC in early 2021. It also ignited a broader conversation about whether more corporations would follow Tesla's lead and allocate some of their treasuries to Bitcoin.Elon Musk's Tweets and Bitcoin's Volatility.Elon Musk's impact on Bitcoin extended beyond Tesla's investment. His prolific and often whimsical tweeting habits started influencing the cryptocurrency's price in ways that few could have predicted.Musk's tweets and public statements about Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies were a double-edged sword. On one hand, his endorsement and public discussion of Bitcoin brought mainstream attention to the cryptocurrency, fueling interest and investment. On the other hand, his tweets could also lead to massive price swings, causing concern and frustration among investors and regulators.One of the most notable episodes occurred in May 2021 when Musk announced via Twitter that Tesla would no longer accept Bitcoin as payment for its vehicles, citing environmental concerns related to Bitcoin mining's energy consumption. This single tweet triggered a sharp decline in the price of Bitcoin, erasing billions of dollars in market value in a matter of hours.The environmental debate surrounding Bitcoin's energy use intensified following Musk's tweet. Critics argued that Bitcoin's energy consumption, driven by the proof-of-work consensus mechanism, was unsustainable and environmentally damaging. Proponents of Bitcoin countered that its energy use was comparable to, or even more efficient than, traditional banking and gold mining.Musk's influence over Bitcoin's price volatility didn't stop there. He continued to tweet about cryptocurrencies, often in cryptic and playful ways. For example, he tweeted about \\\"Baby Doge Coin\\\" and \\\"Shiba Inu,\\\" two meme cryptocurrencies, which led to speculative buying frenzies.These episodes prompted calls for greater regulation of Musk's Twitter activity and its potential impact on financial markets. Regulators expressed concerns about market manipulation and the need for greater transparency in Musk's communication regarding Tesla's Bitcoin holdings and intentions.Elon Musk's Impact on Altcoins.In addition to his influence on Bitcoin, Musk's tweets and comments have also affected various altcoins, which are cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin. Dogecoin, in particular, emerged as a notable example of Musk's ability to move markets.Dogecoin, originally created as a meme cryptocurrency in 2013, gained a cult following on the internet due to its Shiba Inu dog logo and lighthearted community. However, its value remained relatively low and stable for years.In early 2021, Musk began tweeting about Dogecoin, referring to it as\\\"the people's crypto.\\\" His tweets, often accompanied by playful memes and comments, caused massive surges in Dogecoin\\'s price. At one point, it reached an all-time high of over $0.60 per DOGE, a substantial increase from its previous fractions-of-a-penny valuation.Musk's involvement with Dogecoin extended to his hosting of \\\"Saturday Night Live\\\" in May 2021. During the show, he referred to Dogecoin as a \\\"hustle,\\\" which led to a temporary price drop. Nevertheless, his overall engagement with Dogecoin contributed to its growing popularity and market capitalization.The phenomenon of \\\"Musk tweets\\\" driving the prices of cryptocurrencies sparked debates about the role of celebrity endorsements and social media influencers in the cryptocurrency space. It also raised questions about the fundamental value of assets like Dogecoin and the risks of investing based on internet trends and social media hype.The Impact of Elon Musk\\'s Environmental Concerns.Musk\\'s environmental concerns regarding Bitcoin mining were not limited to his May 2021 tweet. He continued to advocate for more sustainable practices within the cryptocurrency industry. He called on Bitcoin miners to transition to renewable energy sources and even engaged in discussions with prominent figures in the cryptocurrency community about potential solutions.These concerns about Bitcoin\\'s carbon footprint drew attention to a longstanding issue within the cryptocurrency space. Bitcoin's proof-of-work consensus mechanism requires significant computational power, which, in turn, demands substantial energy consumption. The majority of Bitcoin mining operations relied on fossil fuels, particularly coal, which contributed to concerns about its environmental impact.In response to Musk\\'s comments and mounting environmental criticism, some Bitcoin miners began exploring cleaner energy sources and sustainable practices. Several Bitcoin mining companies announced commitments to using renewable energy, and discussions about transitioning to a more eco-friendly consensus mechanism gained momentum.Musk's advocacy for sustainability in the cryptocurrency sector highlighted the growing importance of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) considerations for investors and corporations. It also led to broader conversations about the environmental impact of blockchain technologies and the need for responsible innovation in the crypto space.Elon Musk\\'s Evolving Stance on Bitcoin.Musk\\'s relationship with Bitcoin and his stance on the cryptocurrency have evolved over time. While he initially praised Bitcoin for its technological advantages and supported its adoption within Tesla, he later raised concerns about its environmental impact and price volatility.In July 2021, during a B Word conference, Musk revealed that SpaceX held Bitcoin and that he personally held Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin. This disclosure indicated that, despite his reservations, Musk maintained a personal interest in cryptocurrencies.As the year progressed, Musk\\'s tweets about Bitcoin became less frequent, and his public statements about the cryptocurrency became more balanced. He acknowledged that he wanted to see Bitcoin succeed and that Tesla would likely accept Bitcoin again once its mining operations became more environmentally friendly.By late 2021, Musk indicated that he was working with Dogecoin developers to improve the cryptocurrency's efficiency, signaling his continued involvement in the crypto space.Elon Musk, Bitcoin, and Regulatory Scrutiny.The volatility in Bitcoin\\'s price caused by Musk\\'s tweets and statements raised concerns among regulators and lawmakers. The potential for market manipulation and the need for investor protection came into sharp focus.The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and other regulatory bodies began examining Musk\\'s social media activity and its impact on cryptocurrency and stock markets. The SEC had previously clashed with Musk over his tweets regarding Tesla's stock, resulting in legal settlements and restrictions on his communication.While Musk\\'s influence over cryptocurrency markets is undoubtedly significant, the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies remains relatively nascent and complex. Regulators are grappling with how to address the unique challenges posed by the digital asset space, including the influence of high-profile individuals like Musk.Elon Musk's Vision for the Future of Cryptocurrency.Despite the complexities and controversies surrounding Elon Musk\\'s involvement with cryptocurrency, his vision for the future of digital assets and blockchain technology remains of interest.Musk has expressed support for the concept of decentralized finance (DeFi), which leverages blockchain technology to create open and permissionless financial systems. DeFi platforms enable activities like lending, borrowing, trading, and earning interest without the need for traditional financial intermediaries.Furthermore, Musk's involvement with SpaceX and his aspirations for Mars colonization have raised questions about the role of cryptocurrencies in space exploration. Some have speculated that cryptocurrencies could become the primary means of conducting financial transactions and economic activities on future Martian colonies.Additionally, Musk\\'s advocacy for renewable energy solutions aligns with the broader trend of sustainable blockchain technologies. Several cryptocurrencies, like Ethereum, are transitioning from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake consensus mechanisms, which are more energy-efficient and environmentally friendly. Musk's influence and financial resources could potentially contribute to the development and adoption of greener blockchain solutions.Conclusion: The Ongoing Saga of Elon Musk and Bitcoin.The relationship between Elon Musk and Bitcoin has been a rollercoaster ride, characterized by enthusiasm, controversy, and unpredictability. Musk\\'s tweets have demonstrated the power of celebrity influence in the world of cryptocurrency, shaping market sentiment and investor behavior.While Musk\\'s statements and actions have generated significant volatility in cryptocurrency markets, they have also drawn attention to important issues within the industry, such as environmental sustainability and responsible innovation. His involvement has forced a broader discussion about the role of cryptocurrencies in the global economy and their potential to reshape traditional financial systems.As cryptocurrency continues to evolve and mature, it remains to be seen how Musk\\'s influence and vision will intersect with this rapidly changing landscape. Whether through his investments, innovations, or advocacy for sustainability, Elon Musk will likely continue to be a central figure in the ongoing narrative of cryptocurrencies and their place in the digital age.\"\n",
